<h2>Porto</h2>
<p>I was born in Porto, and always kept a keen interest in Science and the Arts. I kept visual arts and writing as parallel interests from young age, and studied Humanities through <a href="https://www.eseq.pt/"> highschool </a>, with a keen desire to learn Philosophy.
</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>I have finished my <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/flup/pt/web_page.inicial"> Degree in Philosophy </a> in 2007, and specialized in Philosophy Education soon after, with a one-year internship in a <a href="https://www.aemaia.pt/index.php/agrupamento/escolas/escola-secundaria-da-maia">highschool in Maia </a> (link: Escola Secund√°ria da Maia).
</p>
<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>Between 2009 and 2013 I developed my Doctoral studies in Schopenhauer Philosophy of Music, having attained the Doctoral Degree in January 2014.
</p>
<h2>Computer Science</h2>
<p>I worked in <a href="https://qa.co.pt/">QA Advertising Agency </a> through 2014 to 2019, in the department of Research and Strategic Planning. That job experience provided me with insight into marketing and business. Meanwhile, a hybrid interest in Philosophy of AI, Computer Science and STEM, together with the aim at shifting and improving my career, has driven me into a new challenge. In order to pursue studies in Computer Science, I quit the job at the Ad Agency, and finished the <a href="https://www.up.pt/fcup/pt/"> Computer Science Degree </a>  in June 2024.
