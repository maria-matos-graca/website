    <h2>Creativity</h2>
    <p>The ability to see across scientific boundaries and produce consistent value, through hard work of technical and creative quality, provides a unique leverage to any endeavor. As someone who came from a uniquely diverse scientific background, in Academic Philosophy and Computer Science, I am a firm believer in the power of creative, multidisciplinary approaches to problem solving, system creation, and innovation.
    </p><h2>Focus</h2>
    <p>The majority of knowledge work achievements demand solitary and focused commitment to a goal and its process, but they do often require organized, consistent teamwork, to put together and bring synergy to any project and produce excellent output.
    </p><h2>Enthusiasm</h2>
    <p>Feeling the accomplishment and value of great work may be one of the most gratifying experiences, and it requires a certain degree of enthusiasm that is driven, not only by the process, but also by the goal.
